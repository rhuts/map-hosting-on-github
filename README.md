# map-hosting-on-github

Taking advantage of Github for hosting a world map, including having the ability to update and view latest changes.


## Idea

Github provides free public and private storage repository storage of 100GB. Your repositories are also hosted for free and accessible to anyone with access to Github.com. Given this large online store of data, one can upload maps and modify them collaboratively with others, without being having to setup infrastructure for hosting the maps.
